# Personal Website Project! (evanlxn.ga)

hello world! Evan here! 
This is the readme for my personal portfolio website!
Over the winter of my freshman year at Cornell, I became super invested in web development, experimenting with ways to compile my personal passion projects into a public portfolio. 
I tested out programs like Netlify, and free domain registrars to distribute my personal website over the internet completely for free. 
Feel free to check back as I update my website with more of my projects to come!
