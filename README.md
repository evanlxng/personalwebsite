# Personal Website Project! (evanlxn.ga)

hello world! Evan here! 


# The Story
This is the readme for my personal portfolio website.
Over the winter of my freshman year at Cornell, I became super invested in web development, experimenting with ways to compile my personal passion projects into a public portfolio. 


I tested out programs like Netlify, Figma, VSCode, Google SEO, and a free domain registrar to distribute my personal website over the internet completely for free. 


# Improvements
I hope to continue adding support for more devices and increasing accesibility to my website. 
Feel free to check back as I update my website with more of my projects to come!
