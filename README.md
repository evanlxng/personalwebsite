# Personal Website Project! (evanlxn.ga)

hello world! Evan here! Welcome to the readme for my personal website!


# The Story
Over the past few months, I've been experimenting with ways to compile my personal passion projects into a public portfolio online. 
</br> The goal has always been to try out new technologies, constantly stay learning, and hopefully along the way I can build valuable skills in a manner that is both cost effective and fun!
In building this website I got to experience and test out programs like Netlify for backend web development; Figma, HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front-end; as well as Google SEO and a free domain registrar to distribute my personal website over the internet completely for free! 


# Improvements
In the future. I hope to expand on the projects that I upload to the website and continue adding support for more devices and increasing accesibility to my website. 
Feel free to check back as I update my website with more of my projects to come!
