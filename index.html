                <h1> A Little About Me!</h1>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> Hello World! My name is Evan Leong and I'm a sophomore at Cornell University studying here in Ithaca NY.
                <p> I'm currently pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, and I built this website to showcase highlights of my journey along the way!
                <br>
                <br>
                    If you want to continue learning about me, my academics, and projects that I'm passionately working on or have worked on in the past,
                    check out the <a href= "featured.html"> Featured</a> and <a href= "updatelog.html"> Resume</a> pages!
                <br>
                <br>
                    If you want to read more about the tools, programs, and work that went into this website behind the scenes, keep scrolling down- you're almost there!

                <h1>About This Page!</h1>
                <p> My main ambition in building evanleong.netlify.app was to help people visualize and follow along with my journey in engineering.
                <br>
                <br>I wanted to create a way for people to not just keep track of how far I've come as a student and an engineer, but also to inspire others to pursue and reflect on their own goals and achievments!
                <br>
                <br>In order to do that, I personally built this website from the ground up and entirely for free.
                <br>
                    From the hosting and SSL certification, to the domain name and software used to draft and build these webpages,
                <br>I wanted to challenge myself to pursue the most cost effective method of building a website to show that it doesn't take much to build a platform on the internet and share your ideas with the world!
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                    Using Figma and Google Drawings to draft the layout of the website, I created all the figures and images you see on these pages by hand! All the physical webpages were then coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                <br>
                <br>
                    All the code for this website has been pushed from VSCode to a public Github repository that anyone can view as new content is added!*
                <br>
                <br>
                    As I progress through my academic and professional career, I hope to continue updating this website with any new information or accomplishments I attain along the way.
                <br>
